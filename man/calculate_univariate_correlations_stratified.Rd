\title{Run Regressions with Clocks and Cells Stratified by Categorical Variables and Save Results}
\usage{
calculate_univariate_correlations_stratified(
  cell_clock_df,
  control_covariates = 1,
  categorical_variables,
  study
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cell_clock_df}{A data frame containing the data with cells, clocks, and other covariates.}

\item{control_covariates}{A character vector of covariates to include in the regression models.}

\item{categorical_variables}{A character vector of categorical variables to stratify the analysis.}

\item{study}{A character string specifying the study name, used for naming output files.}
}
\value{
A data frame with results including Beta estimates and confidence intervals.
}
\description{
This function performs regressions with each clock variable against each cell variable,
including specified covariates, stratified by levels of a categorical variable. It calculates
the confidence intervals for the cell estimates and saves the results to a CSV file.
